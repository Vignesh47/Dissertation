Pre-process dataset by removing special characters, numbers, etc. from user reviews + convert sentiment labels positive & negative to numbers 1 & 0, respectively
Import GloVe Word Embedding to build Embedding Dictionary + Use this to build Embedding Matrix for our Corpus
Model Training using Deep Learning in Keras for separate: Simple Neural Net, CNN and LSTM Models and analyse model performance and results
Last, perform predictions on real App Store reviews
